# Assignment:  Design documentation
Design a calendar invitation system. The admin can invite a user to an event and gather their feedback (example: attending, comments)
Define the technical architecture, user scenario, security risk, scope...

## Existing experience
From my previous experience, typically, user scenarios are meant to cover the entire range of targeted users. I have been to a hackathon where my team divided our target users into four cohorts (groups) based on some attribute. We then came up with examples for users that we had to write on sticky notes and place in each gridspace corresponding to their cohort. My team won that hackathon at KPMG Hungary.  
Since calendar invitation systems have a very wide range of use cases, I will limit the scope to target only users within a certain cohort that matches my target market. I can further limit the scope by locality, and many other attributes.

## User research
I now do research and recap the listed topics in the assigment.

This article gave me a good overview as to what types of documents does a design documentation consists of. It looks like this would take a _lot_ of work, and is usually done by a team of people. 

*Search term: "user scenario examples"*

My process is usually the same for filtering out information quickly. I scan read the atricle in question, and my eye is caught on well structured content, namely: 
> *[...]* So, to have the ingredients for a user scenario, you first must clearly define the following factors:  
> 1. **Background** – who are your users (including their knowledge base and skillset/s)?  
> 2. **Motivations** – what goals do they want to achieve?  
> 3. **Tasks** – what must they do to reach those goals?  
> 4. **Context of use** – how will they encounter your design?  
>     - **Environment** – where will they try to use it?  
>     - **Challenges** – when they try to use it, what can get in their way (e.g., signal loss)?

From here, I can continue with the assignment and define my user scenarios with the attributes listed above. I can also conclude that a user scenario can be associated with a user story in SCRUM terminology. Clearly, I need to disambiguate the terms so that I am sure to meet the requirements of this assignment.

*Search term: "user scenario vs user story"*

> https://www.justinmind.com/blog/user-personas-scenarios-user-stories-and-storyboards-whats-the-difference/

Each of these have a different intented audience. Very nice article, it gave me a good overview and an in-depth comparison between "user scenarios", "user personas", "user stories", and "use cases". I decided to write user scenarios that describe one's persona, background, motivation, etc., user stories in first person, and use cases in third person. From the second article, I see that _scenario planning_ involves the design team, developers and product owner together. 
1. Persona development: define primary persona based on what the team's ideas are
2. Scenario mapping: create a strategy based on the persona
3. Scenario analysis: put the user’s goals into context and walk through the steps that the user would take

*Search term: "calendar invitation system examples"*  
For this search, I find many existing products that I can apply to my problem. Sometimes it is much easier to launch a product on an existing platform (for example, a webshop on facebook marketplace), rather than to waste my resources developing my own solution from scratch. Don't reinvent the wheel!  
I can review each of these solutions one by one and compare the features they offer to better define the scope of what my product would deliver to my targeted users. I should also elaborate that in the context of this assignment, the scope of this project will be extremely limited and not defined by business goals, which is why it does not reflect a real-wold project.

*Search term: "calendar invitation system user scenarios"*  
From the search results I navigate to a page of an existing product that already has a well defined list of possible user scenarios in the context of a calendar invitation system, which I found here: 
> https://help.oncehub.com/help/recommended-configuration  

This is by far the most extensive scope I have encountered so far, which includes many use cases and features, and far exceeds the use cases that this assignment would have to deliver.

## Technology research
I have already conducted a lot of research in what are the best technologies to use to implement a system. In case of a calendar invitation system, I would start by building on an existing technology stack that I have experience with, is quick for development, provides good developer experience (DX), and scales well to large projects. Of course there are many more aspects to consider such as compatibility with other existing solutions, integrations, and so on.
