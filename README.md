## Description

This repository hosts demos for assigments in the job interviewing process.

# Weather React App

> ðŸ—’ **Assignment**
>
> Create an application that downloads the current weather forecast from the following service and displays it in a browser: https://openweathermap.org/api. The application should be written in TypeScript using the ReactJS framework, and your completed application should be uploaded to GitHub and the repo link sent to us.

I will be using `unstated-next` instead of Redux for global state management. Let's bootstrap the project with the typescript template provided by microsoft and in the official `create-react-app` command line arguments:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app --typescript
```

I then start the development server with `npm run start`, make sure my env is set up correctly in VSCode (verify code formatting, linting and typechecks), and get to the task itself. I will focus on the design a bit more this time since this is an assignment for a frontend software engineer position. I will be using Tailwind CSS as a baseline, and since it comes with some modular utility classes. I decided to go with Inter font and the default Material Design type scale for the typography, since it yields a good cross-platform look. The primary color will be the iOS system blue, mostly used for accenting CTAs, links, and interactive elements. I will also be using MapBox for its powerful toolset and data viz technology. OpenLayers and the Dark sky API are worth a mention here, but I won't be using them since the assignment specifies the Open Weather Map API, and since the Dark sky API will be unavailable due to Apple's recent acuirement.
Since weather forecasts are location specific, it seems the app needs access to the user's geolocation. There are built in browser APIs for that, so there needs to be a banner on the top to enable location access the first time the user visits the site, for a better UX. It's possible to use IP based geolocation as a fallback without the user's specific consent. Below the banner, the app attempts to show whatever information the user wants to see immediately. Assuming UX research by other weather providers, this should be current weather status, as well as a forecast for the rest of the week. I will be taking inspiration from the iOS weather app as well as Google Weather in the search results page and in native apps, as well as a popular weather app for iOS that Apple recently acquired called Dark sky. Another important aspect of weather apps is to be location agnostic, in other words, well internationalized. Inlcuding the ability for format temperature values to different units in multiple locales.
I continue by creating a quick mockup of what type of information we can display about the weather in the main screen.

# Jobs React App

[Demo in Production](https://github-jobs-lac.vercel.app)

> ðŸ—’ **Assignment**
>
> The exercise is to create a React app using the GitHub Jobs API: https://jobs.github.com/api.
> Requirements:
>
> - The app should have at least 2 pages. The homepage with a search bar and a list of jobs and a page showing the detailed job's description when the user clicks on a job in the list.
> - Uses React Hooks API, Material-UI (https://material-ui.com/) and React Router (https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)

## Intro

To better demonstrate my ability of strategic problemsolving and documentation, I decided to also document the process of how I complete the assignments. To get started, I open up my terminal and create a new git repository called `portfolio-demo`, so I can version my changes. Within this main folder is where I can create sub-folders for each module. For folders and files I will be using a snake-case naming convention. For this demo, I will be creating two modules, one for the first assignment called `design-documentation` and one for the second assignment: `jobs-react-app`.

## Material UI React app

I have worked 3 years with Material UI, and I have successfully ransitioned an entire production codebase from v1 to v2, then from v2 to v3.
My developer environment is set up using the fish shell, my IDE of choice is VS Code with the appropriate extensions, and the SF Mono font in Chrome Dev Tools, VS Code, and the Alacritty terminal to match the system look and feel. I have added the FiraCode font's ligatures into SF Mono to get a better development experience with symbols. To bootstrap the project, I use the fish shell to execute the following commands:

```bash
curl https://codeload.github.com/mui-org/material-ui/tar.gz/master | tar -xz --strip=2 material-ui-master/examples/create-react-app-with-typescript
mv create-react-app-with-typescript jobs-react-app && cd jobs-react-app
npm install icepick use-http interweave lodash.debounce react-router-dom
```

I use four basic dependencies: `react-router-dom` for clientside routing, `icepick` for treating frozen JavaScript objects as persistent immutable collections to implement a store, `use-http` for making isomorphic http requests with React hooks, `lodash.debounce` to debounce input events in the search form, and lastly, `interweave` to safely render HTML (the description field in the job posting object), filter attributes, autowrap text with matchers, render emoji characters, and so on.

> ðŸ“˜ Note

> _To those using Deno with the VSCode Extension: you should disable it for the Node typescript environment to work._

For the most part, I avoid using default exports with ES6 modules (there are some exceptions), for the sake of better structure and easier to read codebase. I declare the type definitions in a typescript module based on the GitHub Jobs API documentation, also copy it into the inline JSDoc so that the intellisense will help me during the development process. It seems like the folks at GitHub don't have CORS enabled, so I will use a proxy for the GitHub Jobs API through `https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://jobs.github.com`. I created a basic store that uses `use-http` library's built in `onNewData` hook whenever a page component mounts. I designed the store state in a way that it handles data from the two endpoints separately, even though they happen to be the same in case of the `JobPosting` object. I enabled a basic caching strategy with 24 hour expiration for persistance of the fetched data, which is built into the library. I made minor changes to the default theme by using Apple system colors, and the Inter webfont for a native look and feel.
Basic component structure is: the `JobsPage` shows a list of `JobPosting` components. Each `JobPosting` component then navigates to a `JobDetailsPage`, where there is a `BackNavigation` to the original master page. It is important to note that in the `JobPosting` component, I set the `state: { from: location.pathname }` on the router's link props, so that other components know that this page is being navigated from a master to detail view. This way, scroll restoration and the back link can be managed easily by relying on the browser rather than `window.scrollTo(x, y)`.
